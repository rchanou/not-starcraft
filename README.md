# Totally Not Starcraft

Random thoughts on an RTS inspired by Starcraft.

## General
- Weapon trajectories are physics-based
- Line-of-sight vision: can’t see behind objects
- Can’t see units too close to cliffs
- Minerals and gas




## Borgs
- Certain units require certain factory configurations
- Tanks, planes, etc. must refill gas
- Must extend power grid
- FInite energy for abilities
- Mech: slow but agile and portable
- Bike: fast, not agile
- Tank: slow, not agile, siege-able, needs fuel
- Plane: needs launchpad/fuel
- Hovercraft: Moves over bodies of water. Can dive down cliffs?
- Chopper: needs fuel
- Base jumper: Jump off cliffs.
