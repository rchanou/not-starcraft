# Totally Not Starcraft

Random thoughts on an RTS inspired by Starcraft.

## General
- Weapon trajectories are physics-based
- Line-of-sight vision: can’t see behind objects
- Can’t see units too close to cliffs
- Minerals and gas
- 

## Borgs
- Certain units require certain factory configurations
- Tanks, planes, etc. must refill gas
- Must extend power grid
- Finite energy for abilities

### Chasses
- Mech: slow but agile and portable
- Bike: fast, not agile
- Tank: slow, not agile, siege-able, needs fuel
