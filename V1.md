# V1

Pared down first version of the game. Focuses on mech race.

## Mechanics

### Fog of War
  - Roughly based on LOS, obstacles, and terrain height
  - All units have "hearing" range?

### Physics
  - LOS projectiles cannot hit if blocked by obstacles or too close to cliffs
  - Slower to walk uphill
  - Higher terrain can shoot farther? But can be heard from farther away?

### Resources
  - Resource minerals and gas are scattered throughout map and must be physically transported to refineries.
  - Certain units also require refueling
  - Mineral Sources
    - Geodes (liftable obstacle rocks)
    - Scrap/Debris
    - Crag (rough ground, slows movement and can't be built on until mined)
  - Energy Sources
    - Energy plant beams can be intercepted?
    - Pools (shallow pools can be moved through but cause damage)
      - Connected by refinery pipes?
    - Solar Plant
      - Terrain bonus?
    - Plants
      - Occasionally spew lingering toxic cloud

- Not owned by anyone!
