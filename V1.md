# V1

Pared down first version of the game. Focuses on mech race.

## Mechanics

### Fog of War
  - Roughly based on LOS, obstacles, and terrain height
  - All units have "hearing" range
  - Higher terrain units can see and shot farther, but other units can hear them from farther
  - Movement increases "loudness" (for most units)
  - 

### Physics
  - LOS projectiles cannot hit if blocked by obstacles or too close to cliffs
  - Slower to walk uphill (for most units)

### Resources
  - Resource minerals and gas are scattered throughout map and must be physically transported to refineries.
  - Certain units also require refueling
  - Mineral Sources
    - Geodes (liftable obstacle rocks)
    - Scrap/Debris
    - Crag (rough ground, slows movement and can't be built on until mined)
  - Energy Sources
    - Energy plant beams can be intercepted
    Ëœ Higher towers beam farther but are more vulnerable to attack
    - Pools (shallow pools can be moved through but cause damage)
      - Connected by refinery pipes
    - Solar Plant
      - Terrain height bonus
    - Plants
      - Occasionally spew lingering toxic cloud

### Buildings
- Besides initial fortress structure, should this be in the first version?
- Not owned by anyone!

### Production
- All units contain core CPU

- extractor -> blocks

### Energy
- gas/pools -> "pipes" -> converter
- solar converter
